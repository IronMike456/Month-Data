""" 
The distribution of the study time data is significantly different from that of the grades. """

""" Measures of variance
So now we have a good idea where the middle of the grade and study hours data distributions are. However, there's another aspect of the distributions we should examine: how much variability is there in the data?

Typical statistics that measure variability in the data include:

Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum. There's no built-in function for this, but it's easy to calculate using the min and max functions.
Variance: The average of the squared difference from the mean. You can use the built-in var function to find this.
Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance. You can use the built-in std function to find this. """

for col_name in ['Grade','StudyHours']:
    col = df_students[col_name]
    rng = col.max() - col.min()
    var = col.var()
    std = col.std()
    print('\n{}:\n - Range: {:.2f}\n - Variance: {:.2f}\n - Std.Dev: {:.2f}'.format(col_name, rng, var, std))

""" Of these statistics, the standard deviation is generally the most useful. It provides a measure of variance in the data on the same scale as the data itself (so grade points for the Grade distribution and hours for the StudyHours distribution). The higher the standard deviation, the more variance there is when comparing values in the distribution to the distribution meanâ€”in other words, the data is more spread out.

When working with a normal distribution, the standard deviation works with the particular characteristics of a normal distribution to provide even greater insight. Run the cell below to see the relationship between standard deviations and the data in the normal distribution."""
